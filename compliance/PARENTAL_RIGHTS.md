# Parental Rights Notice

**Your Rights Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**

## What is COPPA?

COPPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of children under 13 online. It requires websites and online services to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children.

## Your Child's Account

When your child registers for Keystroke Symphony and indicates they are under 13, we:

1. **Immediately restrict** their account to public demo access only
2. **Send you a consent email** with a secure approval link
3. **Grant free subscriber access** only after you approve
4. **Permanently block** certain features:
   - ❌ Community forum access
   - ❌ Purchasing subscriptions or add-ons
   - ❌ Publicly sharing any content

## What Access Does Consent Grant?

With your approval, your child can:
- ✅ Access all Neural Training exercises
- ✅ Save and track their progress
- ✅ Use the Studio feature (rhythm-based learning)
- ✅ View educational content

## Your Parental Controls

### Parent Dashboard
Access your dashboard at: [yourdomain.com/parent-dashboard](https://yourdomain.com/parent-dashboard)

From the dashboard, you can:

Account deletion is **permanent and irreversible** after 30 days.

### Revoking Consent
To revoke consent without deleting the account:
1. Parent dashboard → "Revoke Consent"
2. Your child's account will revert to public demo access
3. All saved progress remains, but is no longer accessible until consent is re-granted
